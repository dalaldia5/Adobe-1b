# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence: A Generalized BART-Based Approach

## Overview

Our solution implements a generalized persona-driven document intelligence system that works across diverse domains (academic, business, educational) and personas (researchers, analysts, students, etc.). The system uses Facebook's BART model for high-quality text summarization combined with semantic similarity matching to extract and rank the most relevant document sections.

## Key Components

### 1. Generalized Document Chunker
- Uses PyMuPDF for robust PDF text extraction across different document formats
- Implements intelligent paragraph-based chunking to maintain semantic context
- Employs domain-agnostic section detection patterns (numbered sections, capitalized headers, etc.)
- Handles diverse document structures from research papers to financial reports

### 2. Persona-Aware Relevance Ranker
- **BART Integration**: Uses facebook/bart-large-cnn for abstractive text summarization
- **Semantic Similarity**: Employs sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for computing relevance scores
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines semantic similarity (40%), keyword matching (30%), content quality (20%), and section importance (10%)
- **Generalized Persona Detection**: Maps input personas to standardized types (researcher, student, analyst, etc.)
- **Task-oriented Analysis**: Identifies job requirements (review, summarize, compare, learn, etc.)

### 3. Domain-Agnostic Architecture
- **Flexible Keyword Categories**: Supports academic, business, educational, and technical domains
- **Adaptive Scoring**: Automatically adjusts relevance calculations based on identified persona and task types
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Evaluates text structure, length, and informational density
- **Cross-domain Compatibility**: Works with research papers, financial reports, textbooks, and technical documentation

## Technical Implementation

### CPU-Only Optimization
- Uses lightweight sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~90MB)
- BART model runs on CPU with optimized inference
- Total model footprint under 1GB requirement
- Efficient batching for processing multiple documents within 60-second constraint

### Output Generation
- Produces structured JSON with metadata, ranked sections, and refined subsections
- BART-generated summaries for each relevant subsection
- Maintains document source tracking and page number references
- Implements importance ranking based on comprehensive scoring algorithm

## Innovation Points

1. **Generalized Design**: Unlike domain-specific solutions, our approach adapts to any document type and persona combination
2. **BART Integration**: Leverages state-of-the-art abstractive summarization for high-quality text refinement
3. **Multi-dimensional Relevance**: Combines semantic understanding with heuristic patterns for robust ranking
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design allows easy extension to new domains and persona types

This approach ensures high-quality section extraction and ranking while maintaining computational efficiency and broad applicability across the diverse test cases specified in the challenge.
